# AI Content Formatting Guidelines for Notion

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for formatting AI-generated content in Notion to solve the "wall of text" problem and create scannable, actionable knowledge assets.

## Core Principles

### 1. Visual Hierarchy
- **Use Headers**: H2 (##) for main sections, H3 (###) for subsections
- **Add Emojis**: Start each section with relevant emojis for visual scanning
- **Create Breaks**: Use dividers between major sections
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Use toggles for detailed content

### 2. Scannable Structure
- **3-Sentence Rule**: Maximum 3 sentences per paragraph
- **15-Word Bullets**: Keep bullet points concise
- **Sub-bullets**: Use for supporting details
- **Tables for Data**: Present comparative information in tables

### 3. Mobile Optimization
- **Single Column**: Prefer single-column layouts
- **Short Lines**: Keep lines under 80 characters
- **Touch-Friendly**: Use toggles for expandable content
- **Minimal Tables**: Limit tables to 3-4 columns

## Section-Specific Guidelines

### 📋 Executive Summary

## Formatting Components

### Callout Blocks
Use for highlighting important information:

- **💡 Blue Background**: General insights, tips
- **⚠️ Red Background**: Warnings, risks, critical issues
- **✅ Green Background**: Success stories, confirmations
- **📌 Gray Background**: Notes, references

### Toggle Blocks
Use for progressive disclosure:

- Raw content (always collapsed by default)
- Detailed methodology
- Technical specifications
- Extended analysis
- Supporting evidence

### Tables
Best practices:

- Bold headers
- Limit to 3-4 columns for mobile
- Use visual indicators (↗️ ↘️ ✓ ✗)
- Keep cell content brief
- Add totals/summaries when relevant

### Lists
Structure guidelines:

**Bulleted Lists**:
- Main point (under 15 words)
  - Supporting detail
  - Additional context
- Next main point
  - Sub-point with → indicator

**Numbered Lists**:
1. **Sequential Step**: Description
   - Prerequisite or note
   - Expected outcome
2. **Next Step**: Description
   - Important consideration

### Inline Formatting
- **Bold**: Key terms, metrics, important names
- *Italics*: Emphasis, quotes, definitions
- `Code`: Technical terms, commands, file names
- [Links](url): External references, sources
