## Before vs. After Comparison

### Current System (Basic Prompting)

**Summarizer Example:**
```python
prompt = f"""
Please provide a comprehensive summary of the following content:

Title: {title}
Content: {truncated_content}

Please format your response in markdown with the following structure:
## Summary
[2-3 paragraph overview of the main points]

## Key Takeaways
- [Most important insight 1]
- [Most important insight 2]
"""
```

**Issues:**
- Single-shot prompting with no systematic approach
- No role definition or expertise context
- Basic content truncation (naive character limits)
- Limited output validation
- No quality control mechanisms

### Advanced System (Sophisticated Prompting)

**Advanced Summarizer Example:**
```python
system_message = {
    "role": "system",
    "content": """You are an expert content analyst specializing in extracting actionable insights from complex documents. Your mission is to serve busy professionals who need to quickly understand and act on information.

EXPERTISE AREAS:
- Strategic business analysis
- Technical concept simplification  
- Risk and opportunity identification
- Decision-support synthesis

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Prioritize actionable insights over background information
- Use specific, quantitative language (avoid vague terms)
- Structure information by importance and urgency
- Preserve critical context and nuance
- Enable informed decision-making"""
}

analysis_prompt = f"""
ADVANCED DOCUMENT ANALYSIS

Step 1: Content Understanding
[Systematic content recognition and purpose identification]

Step 2: Systematic Analysis Framework
A) MAIN THEMES: What are the 2-3 central topics?
B) KEY EVIDENCE: What data, examples, or proof points support these themes?
C) ACTIONABLE ELEMENTS: What decisions, opportunities, or risks does this present?
D) AUDIENCE RELEVANCE: What would a business professional most need to know?

Step 3: Layered Summary Construction
[Executive summary → Detailed analysis → Action items with validation checkpoints]
"""
