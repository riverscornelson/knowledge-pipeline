# Notion Integration Prompt Optimization

## Problem Analysis

### Current Issues
- **Bloated Output**: 40+ blocks per page (target: ‚â§15 blocks)
- **Low Quality**: 6.0/10 score (target: 8.5/10)
- **Slow Processing**: 95.5 seconds (inefficient chain)
- **Redundancy**: 3-prompt chain with duplicated content
- **Poor UX**: Raw content when Drive links exist

### Root Causes
1. **Verbose prompts** generate unnecessary detail
2. **Chained processing** compounds verbosity
3. **No progressive disclosure** strategy
4. **Missing output constraints** allow bloat
5. **Duplicate content generation** wastes tokens
