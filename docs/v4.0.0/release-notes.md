# Knowledge Pipeline v4.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: November 2024  
**Status**: Production Ready

## üéâ Overview

Knowledge Pipeline v4.0.0 represents a major evolution in intelligent content processing, introducing comprehensive prompt attribution, quality scoring, and enhanced formatting capabilities. This release makes advanced features the default standard while maintaining backward compatibility.

## üöÄ Major Features

### 1. Prompt Attribution System

Every piece of AI-generated content now includes transparent attribution metadata, enabling you to:

- **Track Content Origins**: See exactly which prompt generated each piece of content
- **Version Control**: Monitor prompt performance across versions
- **Debug with Confidence**: Quickly identify and fix content generation issues
- **Optimize Prompts**: Use attribution data to improve prompt effectiveness

```yaml
# Example attribution metadata
attribution:
  prompt_id: "summary_research"
  prompt_source: "notion"
  prompt_version: "2.1"
  quality_score: 85
```

### 2. Quality Scoring Engine

Automatic content quality assessment (0-100%) based on:

- **Relevance (40%)**: How well content matches your research interests
- **Completeness (30%)**: Depth and thoroughness of information
- **Actionability (30%)**: Practical insights and next steps

### 3. Enhanced Notion Formatting

Rich, visually organized content with:

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Headers, callouts, and toggle blocks
- **Attribution Blocks**: Transparent prompt tracking
- **Smart Quotes**: Key excerpts preserved in quote blocks
- **Collapsible Sections**: Better organization for long content

### 4. Dual-Source Prompt Management

Robust prompt system with automatic fallback:

- **Primary**: Notion database for live updates
- **Fallback**: YAML configuration for reliability
- **Seamless Switching**: Automatic failover if Notion unavailable

## üìä Performance Improvements
