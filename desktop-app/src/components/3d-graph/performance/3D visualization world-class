here are my recommendations for making your
  knowledge graph 3D visualization world-class:

  Core Interactive Features

  1. Rich Hover Tooltips

  - Display document title, creation date, content type, and quality
   score
  - Show a brief content preview (first 100-200 characters)
  - Include metadata like source (Drive folder path) and last
  modified date
  - Use HTML-formatted tooltips with proper styling that matches
  your app theme

  2. Direct Navigation Links

  - Make nodes clickable to open the source document in Google Drive
  - Add a "View in Notion" option for processed content
  - Include quick action buttons (e.g., "Related Documents", "View
  Processing History")

  3. Smart Node Visualization

  - Size nodes based on document importance (quality score,
  connection count)
  - Color-code by content type (research papers, market analysis,
  news)
  - Use icons or glyphs to indicate document type at a glance
  - Apply subtle animations for newly added documents

  Advanced Navigation & Search

  4. Intelligent Clustering

  - Group documents by semantic similarity using AI embeddings
  - Create visual clusters for topics/themes with labeled boundaries
  - Allow collapsing/expanding clusters to manage complexity
  - Show cluster summaries on hover

  5. Multi-level Search & Filtering

  - Real-time search that highlights matching nodes
  - Filter by date range, content type, quality score, or custom
  tags
  - Save and share filter presets
  - Show/hide nodes based on relationship strength

  6. Time-based Visualization

  - Timeline slider to see knowledge evolution over time
  - Animate new connections as they form
  - Heat map overlay showing "hot" areas of recent activity

  Relationship Intelligence

  7. Semantic Connections

  - Show relationship types with different edge styles/colors
  - Display relationship strength through edge thickness
  - Add edge labels on hover explaining the connection
  - Highlight citation chains and reference networks

  8. Path Analysis

  - Click two nodes to see all paths between them
  - Highlight shortest semantic path between concepts
  - Show "degrees of separation" between documents

  Performance & UX Enhancements

  9. Progressive Loading

  - Start with high-level clusters, drill down for details
  - Lazy-load node details only when needed
  - Use LOD (Level of Detail) - simpler graphics when zoomed out

  10. Contextual Actions

  - Right-click menu with document-specific actions
  - Bulk selection for comparing multiple documents
  - Export subgraph as image or data
  - Add personal notes/annotations to nodes

  Data Intelligence Features

  11. AI-Powered Insights

  - "Suggested connections" based on content analysis
  - Trending topics visualization
  - Knowledge gaps identification
  - Auto-generated summaries for document clusters

  12. Collaboration Features

  - Share specific graph views via URL
  - Collaborative annotations
  - Change tracking (who added what, when)

  Technical Implementation Tips

  Using the 3d-force-graph library (which you're already using), you
   can implement most of these features:

  // Example enhancements
  .nodeLabel(node => `
    <div class="tooltip">
      <h4>${node.title}</h4>
      <p>Type: ${node.contentType}</p>
      <p>Score: ${node.qualityScore}/100</p>
      <p>${node.preview}...</p>
    </div>
  `)
  .onNodeClick(node => {
    window.open(node.driveUrl, '_blank');
  })
  .nodeVal(node => node.qualityScore / 10)
  .nodeColor(node => {
    const colors = {
      'research': '#4A90E2',
      'market-analysis': '#7ED321',
      'news': '#F5A623'
    };
    return colors[node.contentType] || '#999';
  })
