# Float32Array Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was throwing "Invalid typed array length: -2" errors in the @react-three/drei Line component during 3D graph visualization.

## Root Cause
1. The Line component from @react-three/drei was receiving invalid data when edges referenced nodes that didn't exist
2. When creating Float32Arrays for WebGL geometry, negative array lengths were being calculated
3. The issue was exacerbated by unsorted data from Notion API

## Fixes Applied

### 1. DataIntegrationService.ts
- Updated Notion query to sort by "Created Date" instead of "created_time"
- Fixed checkForUpdates to use createdTime property correctly
- Added proper date sorting for pipeline data

### 2. SimpleGraph3D.tsx
- Added validation in GraphEdge component to check if nodes exist before creating vectors
- Added early return if points array has less than 2 valid points
- Added fallback for edge opacity using both strength and weight properties

### 3. GraphEdge.tsx (standalone component)
- Added comprehensive validation for start/end point arrays
- Validate that coordinates are valid numbers (not NaN or Infinity)
- Added early return if curved points are invalid
- Fixed distance and midpoint calculations to handle invalid data

### 4. KnowledgeGraph3D.tsx
- Added validateGraphData function to clean graph data before rendering
- Filters out edges that reference non-existent nodes
- Validates node coordinates are valid numbers
- Applied validation to all graph data updates (initial load, refresh, real-time)

### 5. OptimizedGraph3D.tsx
- Already had proper null checks for edge filtering
- Added safeguards to ensure maxVisible is at least 1

## Result
These fixes ensure that:
- Invalid edges are filtered out before rendering
- Line components never receive arrays with invalid lengths
- Graph visualization gracefully handles missing or invalid data
- Console warnings help identify data issues for debugging
