# Security Best Practices - Knowledge Pipeline Desktop App

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Knowledge Pipeline Desktop App and provides best practices for maintaining security.

## Security Features

### 1. Encrypted Credential Storage

All sensitive credentials are encrypted using industry-standard encryption:

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Authenticated Encryption)
- **Key Management**: Master encryption key stored in macOS Keychain
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic rotation every 90 days
- **Storage**: electron-store with additional encryption layer

#### Implementation Details:
```typescript
// Credentials are never stored in plain text
const secureConfig = new SecureConfigService();
await secureConfig.saveConfig(configuration); // Automatically encrypted
```

### 2. macOS Keychain Integration

On macOS, the app leverages the native Keychain for maximum security:

- **Master Key Storage**: Encryption keys stored in Keychain
- **Credential Storage**: Sensitive API keys stored separately in Keychain
- **Access Control**: Keychain items are app-specific and user-protected
- **Backup/Export**: Encrypted export functionality for secure backups

#### Usage:
```typescript
// Credentials are automatically stored in Keychain when available
const keychainService = new KeychainService();
await keychainService.setCredential('apiKey', 'sk-...');
```

### 3. Secure IPC Communication

All communication between main and renderer processes is secured:

- **Message Authentication**: HMAC-SHA256 signatures on all messages
- **Replay Protection**: Nonce-based replay attack prevention
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents DoS attacks on IPC channels
- **Origin Validation**: Only accepts messages from trusted origins
- **Session Keys**: Ephemeral keys rotated every 30 minutes

#### Security Protocol:
```typescript
interface SecureIPCMessage {
  nonce: string;      // Prevents replay attacks
  timestamp: number;  // Message expiration
  signature: string;  // HMAC signature
  data: any;         // Encrypted payload
}
```

### 4. Credential Validation

All credentials undergo rigorous validation:

- **Format Validation**: Regex patterns for known API key formats
- **Entropy Analysis**: Ensures sufficient randomness
- **Compromise Detection**: Checks against known compromised patterns
- **Injection Prevention**: Sanitization of all inputs

#### Validation Example:
```typescript
// OpenAI API keys must match specific format
const OPENAI_KEY_PATTERN = /^sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{48}$/;

// Notion tokens require minimum entropy
const MIN_ENTROPY = 3.5; // Shannon entropy
```

### 5. Secure Deletion

When credentials are removed or updated:

- **Memory Wiping**: Secure overwriting of sensitive data in memory
- **File Shredding**: DoD 5220.22-M standard (3-pass overwrite)
- **Metadata Removal**: File names randomized before deletion
- **Keychain Cleanup**: Proper removal from system keychain

#### Deletion Levels:
- **BASIC**: Single random overwrite
- **STANDARD**: 3-pass DoD standard (default)
- **PARANOID**: 7-pass Gutmann-inspired

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Protect Your Device**
   - Use FileVault (macOS) for full-disk encryption
   - Enable automatic screen lock
   - Use strong device passwords

2. **API Key Management**
   - Never share API keys
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Use environment-specific keys (dev/prod)
   - Revoke compromised keys immediately

3. **Backup Security**
   - Store encrypted backups in secure locations
   - Use strong passwords for backup encryption
   - Test backup restoration regularly

4. **Network Security**
   - Use the app on trusted networks
   - Consider VPN for public networks
   - Monitor API usage for anomalies

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Never commit credentials to version control
   - Use environment variables for development
   - Review security patches regularly
   - Follow secure coding practices

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Use `npm audit` regularly
   - Pin dependency versions

3. **Testing Security**
   ```bash
   # Run security audit
   npm audit
   
   # Fix vulnerabilities
   npm audit fix
   
   # Check for outdated packages
   npm outdated
   ```

4. **IPC Security**
   - Always validate IPC messages
   - Use the SecureIPCService for sensitive operations
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Log security events

## Security Architecture

### Encryption Flow
```
User Input → Validation → Encryption (AES-256-GCM) → Keychain/Store
                ↓
         Rate Limiting
                ↓
         Sanitization
```

### Key Hierarchy
```
Master Key (Keychain)
    ├── Encryption Key (Session)
    ├── HMAC Key (IPC)
    └── Backup Key (Export)
```

### Trust Boundaries
1. **Renderer ↔ Main**: Secured via IPC signatures
2. **App ↔ Keychain**: OS-level security
3. **App ↔ File System**: Encrypted storage
4. **App ↔ Network**: TLS for all API calls

## Incident Response

### If Credentials Are Compromised

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Revoke compromised API keys
   - Use app's "Wipe All Credentials" feature
   - Change all related passwords

2. **Investigation**
   - Check API logs for unauthorized usage
   - Review system logs for intrusion
   - Scan system for malware

3. **Recovery**
   - Generate new API keys
   - Restore from secure backup
   - Update security measures
