   - Texture atlasing for node icons
   - Geometry merging for static elements
   - Dispose unused resources properly

3. **Performance Profiles**
   ```typescript
   enum PerformanceProfile {
     HIGH = "high",        // Full effects, 60 FPS target
     BALANCED = "balanced", // Reduced effects, stable 30 FPS
     LOW = "low"           // Minimal effects, maximum compatibility
   }
   ```

4. **Metrics Collection**
   - FPS monitoring with adaptive quality
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Render time analysis
   - Bottleneck identification

   <Route path="/knowledge-graph" element={<KnowledgeGraph3D />} />
   ```

2. **Navigation Update**
   ```typescript
   // Add to Navigation.tsx
   <ListItem button component={Link} to="/knowledge-graph">
     <ListItemIcon><GraphIcon /></ListItemIcon>
     <ListItemText primary="3D Knowledge Graph" />
   </ListItem>
   ```

3. **IPC Channels**
   ```typescript
   // Main process
   ipcMain.handle('graph:getData', async () => {
     return await dataIntegrationService.getGraphData();
   });
   
   // Renderer process
   const graphData = await window.electronAPI.getGraphData();
   ```

#### Testing Strategy:
