  - Full tracking of AI prompts, versions, and metadata
  - Collapsible attribution section in Notion pages (single toggle design)
  - Dual-source prompt management (Notion database + YAML fallback)
  - Token usage and processing time tracking
  - Quality scoring with visual indicators (‚≠ê/‚úì/‚Ä¢/!)

- **Enhanced Notion Formatting**
  - Mobile-optimized content rendering with responsive design
  - Executive dashboard with structured insights and action items
  - Quality indicators integrated throughout content
  - Smart text chunking respecting 2000 character limits
  - Nested toggles for better content organization
  - Semantic markdown parsing for proper block types

- **Prompt Database Integration**
  - New Notion database schema for prompt management
  - Version control and active/inactive prompt states
  - Content-type specific prompt selection
  - Temperature and token limit configuration per prompt
  - Web search capability flags per prompt

- **Core Architecture Updates**
  - `EnhancedPromptConfig` for dual-source prompt loading
  - `PromptAwareNotionFormatter` as primary formatter
  - Enhanced `PipelineProcessor` with attribution tracking
  - Improved validation pipeline preventing API errors
  - Automatic text truncation for Notion limits

- **Performance Improvements**
  - 5-minute prompt caching reducing API calls
  - Tag caching for content tagger (10-minute TTL)
  - Batch processing with configurable sizes (10-50 items)
  - Smart retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Memory-efficient document chunking

### Changed
- Default formatter is now `PromptAwareNotionFormatter`
- Pipeline processor tracks all prompt usage
- Error messages automatically truncated to fit Notion limits
- Text chunking now preserves markdown structure
- Quality scoring algorithm enhanced with multiple factors

### Fixed
- Notion API validation errors with empty children arrays
- Quote blocks no longer include children property
- Text content exceeding 2000 character limit
- Toggle blocks properly structured with valid children
- Error recovery during batch processing

### Technical Notes
- No parallel processing implemented (sequential batch processing only)
- Backward compatible with v3.x YAML prompts
- All v4.0 features can be disabled via environment variables
- Migration is largely automatic with optional enhancements

## [3.0.10] - 2025-01-20

### Removed
- **Summary field** from Notion properties - resolves 200-character truncation issue
  - Full summaries remain available in "üìã Core Summary" toggle blocks
  - No data loss - only removes the truncated property field
  - Existing entries retain their Summary field, new entries won't populate it

### Changed
- Updated pipeline processor to stop populating Summary property
- Modified tests and scripts to remove Summary field references

## [3.0.9] - 2025-07-19 - Released

### Security
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed OAuth2 token storage vulnerability (CVE-level severity)
  - Replaced insecure pickle serialization with secure JSON format
  - Enforces strict file permissions (0600) on token files
  - Tokens now stored in secure location (~/.config/knowledge-pipeline/)
  - Added automatic migration from legacy pickle format
  - Validates token file permissions on load, removing insecure tokens

### Fixed
- Test suite now passes 100% (72/72 tests)
- Fixed text chunking empty separator handling
- Fixed pipeline processor test mocks
- Fixed prompt config test assertions
- Improved exception handling in tests

### Added
- SecureTokenStorage class for proper OAuth2 token management
- Comprehensive test coverage for all core functionality
- Enhanced content tagging system with dual-taxonomy approach:
  - **Topical-Tags**: Subject matter and theme classification (3-5 tags per document)
  - **Domain-Tags**: Industry and application area classification (2-4 tags per document)
  - Intelligent tag generation with consistency enforcement
  - Preference for existing tags to maintain taxonomy coherence
  - Backfill script for tagging existing content
- OAuth2-based Drive uploads to avoid service account quota limits
- Local PDF upload preprocessor for batch processing local PDFs

## [3.0.8] - 2025-07-16
