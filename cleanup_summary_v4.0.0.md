# V4.0.0 File Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-07-21

## Investigation Results

### Files Analyzed
1. **streamlined_prompt_attribution.py**
   - Status: NOT FOUND (only .pyc file exists)
   - Decision: Cannot move - file doesn't exist
   
2. **pipeline_processor_enhanced.py**
   - Status: EXISTS (14,888 bytes)
   - Location: `/src/enrichment/pipeline_processor_enhanced.py`
   - Imports: NOT imported anywhere in Python code
   - Decision: KEEP - Appears to be an early version of enhanced formatting

3. **pipeline_processor_enhanced_formatting.py**
   - Status: EXISTS (11,948 bytes)
   - Location: `/src/enrichment/pipeline_processor_enhanced_formatting.py`
   - Imports: ACTIVELY USED in:
     - `/src/formatters/README.md` (documentation)
     - `/scripts/migrate_to_prompt_aware_formatter.py` (migration script)
   - Decision: KEEP - Actively referenced in documentation and migration tools

4. **cross_prompt_intelligence.py**
   - Status: EXISTS (33,970 bytes)
   - Location: `/src/utils/cross_prompt_intelligence.py`
   - Imports: NOT imported anywhere in Python code
   - Decision: MOVE TO LEGACY - Large file with no active imports

5. **prompt_aware_blocks.py**
   - Status: EXISTS (21,539 bytes)
   - Location: `/src/enrichment/prompt_aware_blocks.py`
   - Imports: NOT imported anywhere in Python code
   - Decision: MOVE TO LEGACY - Appears to be standalone module with no imports

## Conservative Approach Taken

Following the principle "when in doubt, keep the file", I'm only moving files that:
1. Have NO imports in any Python code
2. Are NOT referenced in documentation
3. Are NOT referenced in configuration files
4. Are NOT part of active migration paths

## Files to Move to Legacy

Based on conservative analysis, only these files will be moved:
- `/src/utils/cross_prompt_intelligence.py` - No imports found
- `/src/enrichment/prompt_aware_blocks.py` - No imports found

## Files Kept Despite No Direct Imports

- `pipeline_processor_enhanced.py` - May be used for backward compatibility
- `pipeline_processor_enhanced_formatting.py` - Referenced in docs and migration scripts

## Rationale

The conflicting reports were due to:
1. Documentation references vs actual code imports
2. Migration scripts that reference files for comparison
3. One file (streamlined_prompt_attribution.py) that doesn't actually exist

This conservative approach ensures no functionality is broken while still cleaning up truly unused files.

## Actions Completed

1. **Created backup branch**: `backup/pre-v4-cleanup-20250721`
   - All changes committed before cleanup
   
2. **Created legacy directory**: `/legacy/`
   - Added README.md explaining the moved files
   
3. **Moved to legacy/**:
   - `cross_prompt_intelligence.py` (from `/src/utils/`)
   - `prompt_aware_blocks.py` (from `/src/enrichment/`)
   
4. **Files kept in place**:
   - `pipeline_processor_enhanced.py` - Potential backward compatibility
   - `pipeline_processor_enhanced_formatting.py` - Referenced in docs/migration
   
5. **Files not found**:
   - `streamlined_prompt_attribution.py` - Only .pyc exists, no .py source

## Verification

To verify no functionality was broken:
```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest

# Check imports
python -c "from src.enrichment import *"
python -c "from src.utils import *"
```

## Rollback Instructions

If any issues arise:
```bash
# Option 1: Restore individual files
mv legacy/cross_prompt_intelligence.py src/utils/
mv legacy/prompt_aware_blocks.py src/enrichment/

# Option 2: Full rollback to backup branch
git checkout backup/pre-v4-cleanup-20250721
```
