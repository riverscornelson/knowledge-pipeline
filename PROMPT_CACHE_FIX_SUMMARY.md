# Prompt Cache Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The system was loading 37 prompts from Notion but falling back to YAML prompts because of a cache key mismatch.

### Root Cause

1. **Storage**: When caching prompts from Notion, content types with spaces (e.g., "Market News") were stored as lowercase without replacing spaces:
   - Cache key: `"market news_summarizer"`

2. **Lookup**: When looking up prompts, the code was replacing spaces with underscores:
   - Lookup key: `"market_news_summarizer"`

This mismatch caused the cache lookup to fail, even though the prompts were successfully loaded.

### Content Types Affected

The following content types in Notion have spaces and were affected:
- Market News
- Personal Note  
- Vendor Capability
- Client Deliverable
- Thought Leadership

## Fix Applied

### 1. Normalized Cache Storage (Line 173 in `prompt_config_enhanced.py`)

Changed from:
```python
cache_key = f"{content_type.lower()}_{analyzer_type.lower()}"
```

To:
```python
cache_key = f"{content_type.lower().replace(' ', '_')}_{analyzer_type.lower()}"
```

### 2. Backward Compatibility Fallback (Lines 294-299)

Added a fallback to check the old format if the normalized key isn't found:
```python
if not notion_prompt:
    alt_cache_key = f"{content_type.lower()}_{analyzer}"
    notion_prompt = self.notion_prompts_cache.get(alt_cache_key)
    if notion_prompt:
        self.logger.debug(f"Found prompt with alternate key: {alt_cache_key}")
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging

Added diagnostic logging to help debug cache misses:
- Shows what cache key is being looked for
- Lists matching prompts in cache when falling back to YAML
- Logs all cache keys when populating the cache

## Result

Now when the system processes content classified as "Market News", it will:
1. Look for `"market_news_summarizer"` in the cache (normalized)
2. Find the prompt that was stored with the same normalized key
3. Use the Notion prompt instead of falling back to YAML

This ensures that the 37 prompts loaded from Notion are actually used during processing.

## Verification

The diagnostic script shows the Notion database contains:
- 40 active prompts total
- Prompts for Market News content type:
  - market_news_insights
  - market_news_market (2 versions) 
  - market_news_summarizer
  - market_news_tagger

These will now be correctly matched and used instead of the YAML fallbacks.
