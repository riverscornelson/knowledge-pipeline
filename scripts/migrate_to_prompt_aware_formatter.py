Migration script - NO LONGER NEEDED.
The base PipelineProcessor already includes all v4.0 formatting features.

This script is kept for historical reference but is not needed for v4.0.
All v4.0 features including prompt attribution, enhanced formatting, and quality scoring
are already integrated into the main pipeline_processor.py.

To use v4.0 features, simply ensure these environment variables are set:
- NOTION_PROMPTS_DB_ID: Enable Notion-based prompt management
- USE_ENHANCED_FORMATTING: Enable enhanced formatting (default: true)
- USE_PROMPT_ATTRIBUTION: Enable prompt attribution (default: true)

To run the pipeline with v4.0 features:
    python scripts/run_pipeline.py
